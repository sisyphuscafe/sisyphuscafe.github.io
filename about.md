# Cafe
This is a personal blog and website produced to share interesting, compelling and satisfying content. It is not a cafe. 

There is a fully functional kitchen and dining area, entertainment spaces, alcoves devoted to quiet reflection and of course, a reasonably well-stocked garage and shop for executing wood and metalworking projects, motorcycle building and, on occasion, sheltering 4-wheeled vehicles.

## The Site
After many years developing customer websites as a side-hustle and eventually as an independent business, the time has come to devote some energy to sharing some things that are personally satisfying.

Having been heavily invested in [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) based on the assumption that sites would eventually be handed over to the customer to manage, it became clear that most sites never got handed over to a customer, and in the vast majority of cases, were rarely updated. For many projects, including this one, the infrastructure and maintenance costs were excessive.

## The Tech Stack
This site is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which is based on a static site generation tool called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). The chosen theme is called [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) developed by [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes).

## The Experiment
While this represents a new incarnation for this domain (published in the spring of 2024) it contains a small amount of content that pre-dates the launch, migrated from the previous site.
