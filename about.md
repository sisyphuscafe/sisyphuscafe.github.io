# Cafe
This is a personal website produced to share interesting, compelling and satisfying stories. It is not a cafe. 

That said, there **is** a fully functional kitchen and dining area, entertainment spaces, alcoves devoted to quiet reflection and of course, a reasonably well-stocked garage and shop for executing wood and metalworking projects, motorcycle building and, on occasion, sheltering 4-wheeled vehicles.

## The Tech Stack
This site takes a simpler approach, moving away from heavyweight server-side solutions ([WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)). Instead, the site is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), based on a static site generation tool called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). The chosen theme is called [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) developed by [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes).

## The Experiment
While this represents a new incarnation for this domain (published in the spring of 2024) it contains content that pre-dates the launch, migrated from the previous site.
