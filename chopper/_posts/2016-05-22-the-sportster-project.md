# In the Beginning
In the fall of 1999 a shiny new Harley Davidson Softail Standard (FXST) was purchased and settled happily into the garage. Before logging 1000 miles, planning began for a custom motorcycle build project. This was a childhood dream, and the purchase of the Softail only amplified the dream.

## Dreams Into Action
On a cold Saturday morning in the middle of May, 2016, a dirty old 1998 Harley Davidson Sportster 883 (XLH) was purchased and settled happily into the garage alongside the Softail. With less than 12K miles, the bike is a perfect starting point for my **first** chopper.
