Some hasty research revealed that a Sportster motor weighs between 135 – 175 lbs. Since this seemed like more than the average guy could handle without assistance, it was necessary to do some additional research.

Test: 
1. Visit the gym,
1. Find a pair of 75 lb barbells, and
1. Work with them to see what you’re capable of.

Test Result:
* Fail.

The next plan was to secure mechanical support. Thanks again to Harbor Freight, I found a nifty 1 ton push beam trolley. Fortunately, my garage sports an I-beam to support the weight of the house. In combination with some ancient canvas moving straps, some newly acquired ratchet straps and some good old fashioned wrestling, the motor didn’t stand a chance.

It’s very possible that a few things got bent or broken during the process, but I’m not terribly concerned. I left the thing hang for the night in the garage. 

Penance certainly. For whom/what is up for debate.
